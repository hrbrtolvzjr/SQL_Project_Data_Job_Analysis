# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was created from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from my [SQL Course] (https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's picked with insights on job titles, salaries, location, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for those top-paying jobs??
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I mastered several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspectrs of the daya analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs.
To identify the highest-paying roles I filtered data analyst position by average yearly salary and country. This query highlights th high paying oppurtunities in the field.

SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title_short,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_country,
    name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_country = 'Philippines' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023 in the Philippines:
